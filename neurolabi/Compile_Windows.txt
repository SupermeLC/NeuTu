Compile neuTube in Windows using Mingw64

1.  Make sure perl (>5.10) and awk are installed and added to system path. Awk can be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gawk.htm. Perl can be downloaded from http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads.

2.  Download cmake from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html , install, make sure cmake.exe can be found from system path. 

2.  Download Qt and Mingw from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtx64/files/qt-x64/4.8.6/mingw/seh/",  Choose the "-seh.exe" version which includes both Qt and Mingw64. Install. Assume the install directory is $INS_DIR, add "$INS_DIR/qt-4.8.6-x64-mingw-seh/mingw64/bin" and "$INS_DIR/qt-4.8.6-x64-mingw-seh/bin" to system path. 

3.  Download QtCreator from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtx64/files/qt-creator-x64/3.0.1/". Install. 

4.  Make sure msys or any sh.exe is not in system path. (If you don't know what it is, ignore this)

4.  Go to neurolabi folder under neuTube src folder, Double click cmake_update_library.bat to compile c library. This should generate libneurolabi.a and libneurolabi_debug.a in /neurolabi/c/lib/ folder.

5.  Open QtCreator, configure Kits with qmake.exe in "$INS_DIR/qt-4.8.6-x64-mingw-seh/bin" (refer to QtCreator document for how). 

6.  Open project /neurolabi/gui/gui.pro in QtCreator, Build. After building, go to folder /neuTube_win64 and run neuTube.exe
